# SyntaX: The Library Collection (SLC) 🚀

**SyntaX** is a unified, lightweight, and professional utility ecosystem designed to bring the **simplicity of Python's syntax** to every major programming language. 

Are you tired of switching between different naming conventions like `std::cout`, `System.out.println`, or `Console.WriteLine`? The **SyntaX Family** provides a consistent, cross-language API that allows you to focus on logic rather than boilerplate code.

---

## 🌟 The SyntaX Philosophy

The core goal of this collection is **Standardization**. Whether you are working on a low-level C project or a modern Node.js backend, SyntaX ensures that your favorite helper functions—like `print()`, `input()`, and `randint()`—stay exactly the same.
